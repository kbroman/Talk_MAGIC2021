### Talk on &ldquo;QTL mapping in MAGIC populations with R/qtl2&rdquo;


These are slides for talks I gave for Jeff Endelman's genetic mapping course
at UW-Madison in Spring, 2021. They are based on a talk
I gave at Michigan State University on 12 Dec 2019, which was a
revised and expanded version of a talk I gave at the [MAGIC
workshop](http://mtweb.cs.ucl.ac.uk/mus/www/MAGICdiverse/MAGIC_workshop.htm)
in Cambridge, UK, on 23 July 2019.
