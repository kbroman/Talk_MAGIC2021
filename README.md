### Talk on &ldquo;QTL mapping in MAGIC populations with R/qtl2&rdquo;


These are slides for a talk that I gave at the [MAGIC
workshop](http://mtweb.cs.ucl.ac.uk/mus/www/MAGICdiverse/MAGIC_workshop.htm)
in Cambridge, UK, on 23 July 2019, and then revised and expanded for a
talk at Michigan State University on 12 Dec 2019.
